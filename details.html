<h3> Research/Teaching Assistant openings:</h3>

<p> 1) I have ideas in the following topics: <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; c) Reliable operation of autonomous driving systems <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; d) Reliable operation of neural networks <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; e) Reliability study at the compiler level <br> 
&nbsp; I am open to other ideas as well! <br>
<br>


2) Size of my group: 2~4 students. <br><br>
